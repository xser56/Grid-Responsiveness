              <h5 class="card-title mb-4">In MapleStory, Kanna is a unique Magician class from the Sengoku job branch, originating from the Japanese-inspired region of Momijigaoka. She wields a fan as her main weapon and has a familiar (Haku) who supports her in battle.</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Kanna's skills focus heavily on crowd control, summoning spirits, and using Shikigami abilities to deal damage over wide areas, making her one of the best classes for mobbing. Her playstyle includes passive buffs that increase spawn rates and yield higher EXP, which makes her highly desirable for farming. Kanna also excels at supportive abilities like providing party members with extra mana and health regeneration. However, her reliance on mana and specific skill combos can make her more challenging to manage in long battles.</p>
